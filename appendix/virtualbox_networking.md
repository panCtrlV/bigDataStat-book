# VirtualBox Networking

VirtualBox provides up to eight virtual PCI Ethernet cards for each virtual machine. For each such card, you can individually select (1) the hardware that will be virtualized as well as (2) the virtualization mode that the virtual card will be operating in with respect to your physical networking hardware on the host.
