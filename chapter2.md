## 1. Parallel Computing with Multi-threading

Multi-core CPUs are very common these days. This is true even for laptop's CUPs. Intel Core i5 is duel-core and Intel Core i7 is usaually quad-core. Intel has a proprietary simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology called Hyper-threading Technology (HTT). It improves parallelization of computations performed on x86 microprocessors. With HTT, one physical core appears as two processors to the operating system, allowing concurrent scheduling of two processes per core.[TODO: copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading, need to be rephrased]


## 2. Cluster Computing

## 3. Cloud Computing
