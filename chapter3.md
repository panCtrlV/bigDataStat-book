# Chapter 3 Building a Cluster

The purpose of this chapter is to allow readers to have a taste of cluster computing without taking a lot of effort to find a cluster. 

A virtual machine cluster is a poor man's solution. While building a virtual machine cluster, you act as a cluster administrator who has the full control of the nodes. 

One can also rent a cluster from Amazon's EC2. This allows you to scale up the ideas we tested on a virtual machine cluster.
