# Chapter 4 Statistical Analysis with R

---

- Some features of R language

  * Dynamic typing (<font color='red'>== type inference?</font>)
  * Lexical scoping
  * Object oriented (everything is an object)
  * <font color='red'>Functional programming?</font>
    + Pattern 1: pass a function as an argument to another function, e.g. apply(data.frame, fun)

- Limitations of R

  * Inability to scale (due to single threaded computing paradigm and poor memory management)
