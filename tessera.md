- HDFS ï¼‹ MapReduce

  * HDFS as distributed data storage
    + Read data from HDFS to multiple workers on different nodes (keep data close)

  * Hadoop YARN/MRv2 as the computing backend
    + Map: Process data on each worker (parallel)
    + Reduce: Shuffle data (map output) and do additional processing on each worker

- R as the front end
- Rhipe as the connector between R and Hadoop
