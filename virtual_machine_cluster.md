# Virtual Machine Cluster

Cluster can be very expensive to build. It consists of many computer nodes, network switches, internet cable and other hardware equipments. It also requires installation of operating systems and managment softwares to be functioning. Dedicated administrating staff are also needed to maintain the whole system. 

All of above make clusters in-accessable to students and individual researchers. Usually, having access to a real cluster is desirable but not a must for many research programs. At the early stages of many research projects, we usually pilot our method on a small data set or a subset sampled from a big data set. The purpose is to have a priliminary sense of the data at hand and test if the methods could work.

In these cases, a large scale computing environment cannot be fully utlized. It would require a lot of overhead to get access to a cluster even before we can compute a mean for our data. Rather, we could use our controllable resources, i.e. personal computers, for emulating such a distributed computing environment. A good way to realize such an emulated environment is to build a local cluster consisting of virtual machines.
