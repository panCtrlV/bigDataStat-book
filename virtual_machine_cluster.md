# Virtual Machine Cluster

Cluster can be very expensive to build. It consists of many computer nodes, network switches, internet cable and other hardware equipments. It also requires installation of operating systems and managment softwares to be functioning. Dedicated administrating staff are also needed to maintain the whole system. 

All of above make clusters in-accessable to students and individual researchers. Usually, having access to a real cluster is desirable but not a must for many research programs. At the early stages of many research projects, we usually pilot our method on a small data set or a subset sampled from a big data set. The purpose is to
